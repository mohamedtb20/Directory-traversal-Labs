goal : is to get the data of the file passwd by path traversal and by passing the required extension .png 

Null Byte Injection is an active exploitation technique used to bypass sanity checking filters in web infrastructure by adding URL-encoded null byte characters : %00
Like impassing the type of file if is it true .png or .txt 

steps :
1-we intercept the product detail page by burp suite
2-we can get product image response
3-we send the get request result to the reapeter
4-we just add out path traversal  ../../../etc/passwd and 00%.png after passwd (we added the null bits)

finnally : we get ../../../etc/passwd00%.png
