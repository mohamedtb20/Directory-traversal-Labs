lab : https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode

goal : is to bypass the path traversal block by url encoding

what'is url encoding :

Input (request)  : hamid & lala 
Url : www.kaka.com/search=hamid&lala
The url is in decoded format that means our inpurt is the same on the url
Url :www.kaka.com/search=hamid+%26+lala
The url is in coded format we see + %26â€¦.
So :
When : we send an input to a web browser the web browser has url encoded it before sending it to the web server to get the result

steps :
1-we intercept the product detail page by burp suite
2-we send the get request result to the reapeter
3-we try to code the path traversal parameters like : the coded version of / is %252f ...
4-finnally we can get the result by :..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd
