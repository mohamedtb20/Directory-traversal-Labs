goal : is to find the /etc/passwd content
problem : we can't travel through directories from the filename of the image to the /etc/passwd file
solution :the filname given is trated as a default working directory

stes : 
1-we intercept the product detail page by burp suite
2-we can get product image response
3-we send the get request result to the reapeter
4-we change the filename path to the /etc/passwd
finnaly we get the result the content of the /etc/passwd
